//the circular LL is of two types:

//1.Single circular LL ----> In this all things remain like single LL, only one change that is the last node points to first node
// instead of null which makes it circular

//2.Double circular LL ----> In this all things remain like double LL, only one change that is last node point to first and first point to
//last that makes it circular

//In this file we will talk about the "Single circular LL"
